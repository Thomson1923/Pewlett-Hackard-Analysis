# Re: Upcoming “Silver Tsunami”

# Overview of the analysis
## In light of the anticipated surge in retirements among Pewlett-Hackard employees (internally dubbed the “Silver Tsunami”), we assessed the size and composition of the employee base that will likely retire as well as the remaining staff that may serve as mentors for new employees. Based on our findings, we recommend (1) reviewing future staffing needs to quantify the number of retiring employees that should be replaced and (2) broadening the qualifications of potential mentors to increase the employees that may contribute in this program. 

# Results – The key findings of our analysis include:
## - We found that 90,398 current employees met the criteria (i.e. born during the 1952-1955 time frame) for likely near-term retirements (https://github.com/Thomson1923/Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis/blob/main/Near-Term%20Retirements%20by%20Title.pdf)
## - Among the likely retirees, over 63% hold the titles of Senior Engineer or Senior Staff
## - Using the current limiting definition of potential mentors (only those employees born during 1965), we have only 1,549 employees that could serve as mentors (https://github.com/Thomson1923/Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis/blob/main/Mentor%20Candidates%20by%20Title.pdf)
## - We do not currently have any active employee that meets the criteria for a mentor to new Managers

# Summary
## As noted above, we anticipate that 90,398 employees will retire in the new future and that only 1,549 employees meet the criteria as mentors to new employees. Expanding the criteria for mentors to those employees born in the 1960-1970 time frame would increase the pool of mentors to 93,756 employees, thereby providing enough support for the program.
